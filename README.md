## Implemention of Wi-Fi, I2C, SPI, UART, and One-Wire protocols in Raspberry Pi pico

In this project we encrypt a 64-byte string using the "Tiny AES in C" library and sends the cypertext over these protocols. On the other hand we decrypt the received messages and show them in the serial monitor.

we provided our implementation of one-wire slave in the corresponding directory. Also full report, stats, and charts are in the report.pdf.
